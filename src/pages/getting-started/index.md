# Authentication

Learn how to authenticate requests to GenStudio Experience API.

## Overview

Every request made to GenStudio Experience API must include an encrypted access token.

Your secure, server-side application retrieves an access token by making a request to the [Adobe Identity Management System (IMS)][1] with your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have worked with your Adobe representative and have the following:

- An [Adobe Developer Console][2] account.
- A [project][3] with GenStudio Experience API [OAuth Server-to-Server credentials set up][4].
- Access to your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the [Adobe Developer Console project][5]. Securely store these credentials and never expose them in client-side or public code.

## Retrieve an access token

A temporary access token validates calls to the API. You can [generate an access token can directly in the Developer Console][8], or programmatically by following the steps below.

1. Open a secure terminal and export your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** as environment variables so that later commands can access them:

  ```bash
  export EXP_GS_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID=<Your_Client_ID>
  export EXP_GS_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET=<Your_Client_Secret>
  ```

2. Run the following command to generate an access token:

  ```bash
  curl --location 'https://ims-na1.adobelogin.com/ims/token/v3' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
  --data-urlencode "client_id=EXP_GS_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID" \
  --data-urlencode "client_secret=EXP_GS_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  --data-urlencode 'scope=openid,AdobeID,additional_info.projectedProductContext,read_organizations'
  ```

  The response will look like this:

  ```json
  {
      "access_token": "exampleAccessTokenAsdf123",
      "token_type": "bearer",
      "expires_in": 86399
  }
  ```

  The response includes an `expires_in` field that specifies the length of time, in seconds, that the access token is valid. After the access token expires, your application must request a new token.

3. Export your access token as an environment variable:

  ```bash
  export EXP_GS_SERVICES_ACCESS_TOKEN=<Your_Access_Token>
  ```

## Make your first API call

[If applicable, include a verification call to the specific API.]
